# Divisibility Test Write a Python program to check if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.


num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))


if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
    print(f"The number {num} is divisible by both 3 and 5.")
elif num % 3 == 0:
    print(f"The number {num} is divisible by 3 but not 5.")
elif num % 5 == 0:
    print(f"The number {num} is divisible by 5 but not 3.")
else:
    print(f"The number {num} is neither divisible by 3 nor by 5.")
Enter an integer: 30
The number 30 is divisible by both 3 and 5.
